# PRAISE THE BOX

Welcome to **The Box**! A game where one lucky person will win everything! ~~(and the rest may lose everything)~~

## Rules

1. Each player starts with a set of items in their house.
2. There are two phases in each turn:
    - At 9 PM, one unlucky player loses a random item from their house.
    - At 5 PM, one lucky player gets the chance of retrieving a (random) lost house item, or **getting an awesome gift from The Box** ~~(gifts are not actually awesome, most of them could be labeled as useless, but some could mean the difference between life and death)~~. The gift is also random and expires in 4 turns.
3. The player that survives the longest wins, it's easy!

## How to use

Create a file called `players.csv` with the names of each players (one per row). Then execute for example `python the-box.py 100` (for a box with 100 items).
